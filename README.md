Before getting everything to work I needed to install:
- Python
- Selenium through pip install
- Webdriver through selenium

Once everything was installed and GitHub desktop was also installed I could create a repository to store all my files.

So the setup of the environment took longer than coding did as my PC wasn't setup for testing.
